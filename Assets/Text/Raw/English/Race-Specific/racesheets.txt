History
They're ghost stories. Frightful tales whispered to children by nightcycle lamps. Dread accounts told to fellow sailors in the humming darkness of long-haul freighters.
Even now, in our growing enlightenment, when we know so much more about the Shaleri passage and its strange inhabitants, the sheer <i>differentness</i> of the Shaleri and its Ghosts seduce such tales to persist.
An almost endless variation of hearsay and rumor can be found on the topic off the Shaleri anomaly. Rare records of purported fact are, at best, of irregular verifiability. While now a respected sociological study, what is truly known of the Shaleri remains infinitely smaller than the abundance of myth that clouds its past.
For millennia, space in proximity of the Shaleri anomaly has been mistrusted and avoided by spacefarers. Despite the undeniable historic universality in avoiding this region, few concrete explanations have been made as to the reason for such aversion. Some simply denote the area as "high risk." Others conjecture that the area ebbs with "unknown radiation." Regrettably, most navigation records simply refer to the Shaleri region as "bad space" - the superstitious spacefaring analogy of "here be dragons."
What is known for sure, is that Shaleri space has over time been responsible for an unusually high number of missing vessels. An <i>extraordinarily</i> high number, in fact. For such a high proportion of lost traffic the absence of distress beacons, message capsules, or any signs whatsoever of the missing ships has been described in official records as "disturbing." It is perhaps more aptly described using a favored term of sailors and storytellers, <i>spooky</i>.
The mystery of the Shaleri region goes further and deeper than just that of missing spaceships. Among crews that have safely made journeys through the region, there are records of strange equipment malfunctions, bad dreams, and sudden illnesses. There are accounts of purported "sightings": eldritch encounters with beings described as strange fibrous clouds of energy. While such accounts may have been dismissed in the past as the fantasies of oxygen-deprived sailors, the hindsight of our recent association with the Ghosts place these reports in a more credible light.
There are several trade routes that when traced <i>through</i> rather than <i>around</i> Shaleri space will save the traveler substantial time and fuel. It follows, therefore, that willingness to brave its dark reputation has come with substantial profit for those captains who dared to travel in this "bad space" and returned to tell the tale. It was in pursuit of such profit that the Mentak frigate <i>Entropic</i> undertook its fifth journey through Shaleri space.
The <i>Entropic</i> had been traveling through Shaleri space for three days when it was interdicted by three formidable vessels of unknown origin. The vessels, each the size of a Mentak battlecruiser, were of grey lobstered steel, their surface intricately inscribed with interweaving runic latticework. It is this meeting between the <i>Entropic</i> and the Creuss warships that we mark as First Contact between the Ghosts of Creuss and a member race of the galactic council.
It's not known why the beings that well within the Shaleri anomaly (now commonly called the "Creuss Gate") chose to reveal themselves during the early Years of Awakening. Perhaps they'd finally learned enough about the galaxy that surrounded them? Perhaps their societal progress had finally propelled them into the greater universe? A more ominous possibility, one favored by storytellers, is that the Ghosts of Creuss have come forth for some sinister purpose yet to be revealed.
As beings of energy and light, the Ghosts certainly can be placed among the strangest of the known races. The famous historian Merean Barqan described them as "ethereal luxsynaptic souls." As their forms do not remain stable outside the strange gravity of the Creuss itself, the Ghosts garb themselves in intricate metalwork. Not only does the armor stabilize the Ghosts, but its tangible shape places members of the other races more at ease in their presence. Individual Creuss can be discerned from one another by the unique design of their helmets, which, like their ships, are intricately carved with runes.
The Ghosts of Creuss have shown themselves to be perfectly civilized, polite, and masters of many strange sciences and materials. Yet, they're also regarded as exceptionally secretive, ritualistic, and prickly on a wide range of matters. It's generally undecided whether their behavior is one to be expected of a race so recently introduced to the material galaxy, or whether these are signs that something more ominous lurks beneath their brooding metal helmets.

History
Under the punishing rays of the massive star Kenara lies the tri-system if the Hacan. Each of its three satellites wrapped in the yellow haze so distinctive of desert planets. These three jewels are called Arretze, Kamdorn, and Hercant. Here, the united Emirates of the Hacan have grown a mighty civilization of warriors, nomads, farmers, and above all; merchants.
The Kenara system is one of the most heavily trafficked in the known universe. Only the wormhole portal systems see more traffic in any given cycle. From Kenara, an untold number of Hacan and other merchant vessels traverse the galaxy. This traffic is supported by tire cities of space stations that provide the warehousing, logistics, maintenance, banking, entertainment, and other necessities facilitating the constant flow of goods, ships, and crew.
On the surface of the three hot desert planets, life is slower and more serene. Only life in the city of Harcarun on the planet Arretze matches the breathless pace of the space above. Located in a shadowy vale near the Arretze northern pole Harcarun is the only city in the tri-system that has a fixed position. Its permanent location and almost bearable climate has made Harcarun the primary point of operation for most non-native trading corporations, financiers, and opportunists. The Hacen, despite their uncanny ability for establishing financial relationships and building trade, generally despise the chaotic lifestyle and, to them, windy cold of Harcarun.
The Hacan people dwell mostly in cities built on massive dust-sleds, constantly moving to cooler climates as the desert seasons shift. Although some technology has been introduced in the last hundred years, most Hacan cities are still pulled by vast herds of Tuuran beasts, whose gill-like skin membranes take moisture from the very air itself.
In their distant past, the Hacan were a poor species, their exploits into space dwarfed by the other great races of the Imperium. Then slowly the Hacan discovered an insatiable off-worlder lust for special products grown under Kenara's blinding light or dug from the deep sands of their homeworlds. The intoxicating gerr root, clothes made from the starflowers that only rise during Hercant's equinox, Spehat aphrodisiacs, liquors, medicines, and forbidden drugs. All harvested and manufactured by the craft and patient hands of the Hacan.
Soon the Hacan became masters of trade, and their system prospered as unfathomable fortunes were made by the increasingly powerful trading clans, chief among them the Mowshir Emirate of Arretze. The desire to protect their newfound wealth, and a will to peacefully regulate and arbitrate between the clans, moved the Hacan to form a representative gathering and to elect a Quieron - the leader who speaks for all the Hacan. The Quieron leads the entire hierarchy of trade-groups, each possessing its own fleets of commerce and war. His task: to lead his people to the Imperial Throne, establishing an era of wealth and peaceful commerce.

History
Even the oldest annals recognize the ancient kingdom of the reptilian Xxcha as the first of the great interstellar civilizations. Nestled in the middle of a wealthy section of space, the Xxcha twin planets of Archon Ren and Archon Tau lie bathed in the gentle light of the Xxlak star. While the Xxcha still call the two planets "twins," an outsider will instantly notice that the grayish and shadowy Archon Tau in no way resembles the brilliant, healthy green of Archon Ren.
Throughout the tenure of the lost Lazax Imperium, the Xxcha were the most peaceful, docile, and content of the major civilizations. They did not, unlike the other races, scheme for power and territory during the Age of Dusk. Unlike the Lazax, the Xxcha elders did see the growing threat to the galaxy. They fruitlessly sought to warn the Lazax of their peril, and struggled to bring dialogue to the increasing racial factionalism. A powerful Lazax councilor by the name of Ibna Vel Syd listened to the Xxcha warning, but even he could not sway the false sense of safety felt by the emperor. Then, disaster struck. The Quann crisis erupted into sudden war, and the Letnev, led by the Baron Daz Arrokan I, moved towards the rich Xxcha system in conquest. The Xxcha, unprepared and weaponless, used their formidable powers of negotation and goodwill, to broker an agreement in which they ceded only Archon Tau to the invaders, while the kingdom retained a Letnev-supervised autonomy on Archon Ren. The Xxcha, never fools, were aware of the nature of Letnev promises and the futility of the arrangement. The agreement would only last as long as the Barony was occupied in war elsewhere. In time, the Xxcha knew, the Letnev would return to claim the rest of their prize and enslave them. It was then, for the first time in their history, that the Xxcha started to create their first weapons and train their first armies. In secret deep groves and in hidden vales, the Xxcha king sadly watched his people develop into warriors.
Less than a decade after the occupation of Archon Tau, the Letnev fleet suffered a stunning defeat against Sol in the Gral system. Only a few cycles after that battle, the Sol Phoenix fleet entered the Xxlak system and engaged the heavily fortified Letnev positions on Archon Tau. The ensuing bombardments and battles lasted for almost two years. In the end, the Letnev occupiers were defeated, but with a terrible toll. The ecology of Archon Tau had been shattered beyond recall. What was once a true twin to the green and fruitful Archon Ren was now a noxious, blackened crater. Its forests had burned. Ashes and scattered dust starting a planet-wide winter that lasted for a hundred years, killing most plant and animal life.
Now, recovered from the loss of Archon Tau, the Xxcha kingdom has prospered on the generous Archon Ren. Covered by mostly leafy forests, small inland oceans, and fruitful jungles, Archon Ren is rich in minerals, energy, foodstuffs, and water. The Xxcha civilization dwells in a myriad of arboreal villages and towns. The only true metropolis is the giant city of Kklaj, found on the planet's southern hemisphere. Kklaj functions as the seat of the Xxcha King, whose extensive palace, entirely sculpted of Q'waar wood, and flower gardens, stretch for miles at the center of the city.
The Xxcha are an inherently peaceful, slow, and thoughtful people. They hold their nobles and town elders in deep respect. A common pastime of Xxcha males and females alike is to debate meaning and origin while smoking gerr root on long-stemmed pipes. The jungles and lakes of Archon Ren are surprisingly free from the invasive insects that so often make forest and jungle planets unbearable.
Although the Xxcha still believe in the doctrine of peace and negotiation, they will never again bend to foreign invasion. Travelers of the Xxlak system will often notice impressive sentinel Xxcha superdreadnoughts and the distinctive Xxlun fighters in intense naval exercises. Although the typical Xxcha may seem slow and encumbered by a heavy reptilian body weight, when roused, the Xxcha are surprisingly strong and fast.
The pale shadow of Archon Tau hangs like a scar in the Xxcha skies. The sight of it is the everlasting sorrow of the Xxcha, and the ever-present reminder of the cost of submission. The Xxcha will never allow such tragedy to befall them again. Ccrysus, the Xxcha King, knows that for the sake of a peaceful galaxy, the Xxcha must seek the Imperial Throne and be wise for all.

History
Brightest in the Morgallen Cluster burns the old star Farruban. While sun to no less than 26 satellites, Farruban's only inhabitable planet is the tropical giant of Nestphar, a planet teeming with life so abundant it almost defies description.
On first approach to Nestphar, a first-time visitor may be surprised by the soupy haze that bleeds from the atmosphere like a dusty cloud. This cloud consists of quadrillions of tiny living spores emitted by Nestphar's many <i>Flaah</i>, city-sized floating forests in its stratosphere. The short-lived (and therefore continually resupplied) orbital presence of the Flaah spores allows the Arborec denizens in Nestphar's space-stations and shipyards to remain in continous symbiotic contact with their planet. The Arborec term for this vital connection, shared among all living things on Nestphar, is best translated as "the Symphony."
The Arborec should be described not as a race, but as an intelligent ecosystem consisting of countless biological specimens, from the smallest spore to the complex fungal organisms of the <i>Letani</i>.
When traveling beyond the reach of Nestphar's Flaah spores, and therefore outside connection to the prime Symphony, the Arborec employ the massive Letani. Physically, the Letani are the largest sentient beings yet discovered in the galaxy (each slightly larger than a Sol <i>Elephantus</i>), their bodies resembling a kraken-shaped mushroom crossed with a monstrous carnivorous flower. The Letani are each uniquely capable of embodying a powerful instance of the Symphony (and therefore closest to an "individual" within Arborec society) which may act as an harmonic nexus for Arborec organisms in near proximity. All ships in the Arborec fleet are based around the presence of at least one (with some ships as many as five) Letani orchestrating the unity of Arborec lifeforms crewing the vessel.
Once a Letani returns to the embrace of Nestphar's prime Symphony, its experiences are reconnected and absorbed into the Arborec, as a date-capsule would be reconnected to its mainframe.
The admittance of the Arborec to the galactic council was undoubtedly the most controversial in the council's long history. A small group of elder races - led by the humans of Sol - viciously protested admittance by reason of moral impediment.
While surely intelligent and demonstrably capable of crafting impressive technologies, structures, and a sophisticated fleet of interstellar craft, the Arborec's method of <i>communication</i> remains a source of great controversy. Being a race of vegetative and fungal matter, handling its own data transmission and emotive projection through the prime Symphony, the Arborec had never developed any form of visual or auditory communication (concepts which, to this day, remain foreign to them).
Arborec scientists had found the solution to this dilemma in the Sol merchant vessel <i>Dies Opulen</i>. The crew of the <i>Dies Opulen</i> had tragically become infected by Yborin Plague on Maaluk and had later dies in deep space. When the derelict ship was found by an Arborec scout, it was determined the cool bodies of the human crew were in perfect condition for an ambitious experiment. The bodies were sent to the great laboratories in Kushin, near the Arborec capital Phara.
Here, fungal <i>Arzuga</i> cells were attached to the brainstems of the dead humans. It was hoped, when grown under proper conditions, the complex acidic properties of Arzuga would successfully merge the cells with the innate brain-tissue of the deceased subjects, slowly re-stimulating the neural pathways back to life. Then, by injecting photo-voltaic stems into the soft tissues of the dead body, the neurally active Arzuga would spur the soft tissue cells to heal and regrow, effectively reanimating the dead body.
The experiment was a rousing success, and one that would change the destiny of the Arborec.
Symbiotically attached to the host body, the Arzuga fungi evolved into a new being, one which the Arborec call the <i>Dirzuga</i>.
The Dirzuga were the missing link between the Symphony and the manifestation of physical communication that the Arborec lacked. Over the following few decades, the Arborec eagerly acquired additional subjects (human bodies seem to work best and are the most frequently used, but Letnev, Winnu, and Xxcha bodies are also commonly used as Dirzuga hosts), establishing a sizable diplomatic and trading corps that have become the basis for the Arborec's interaction with the rest of the galaxy.
The Arborec insist the host bodies of the Dirzuga are devoid of the expired individuals' consciousness. With a cultural relationship to death rooted in the natural cycle of decomposition and regrowth, the Arborec have little understanding or sympathy for those who vigorously protest against the bodies of their citizens being reused (some use the term "enslaved") in such a manner.
Ultimately, despite the objections of the dissident races, the Arborec were admitted as a member of the galactic council. The potential wealth of foodstuffs, medicines, and other treasures of Nestphar proved effective in overcoming any objections.
While the Arborec insist that that the past knowledge and experiences of Dirzuga bodies do not persist, there are some who suspect the Arborec do not tell the entire truth. Such theorists can provide many examples in which the Arborec seem to have come upon information, or intimate understanding of other cultures, that seem inexplicable otherwise.
If some memories and knowledge of the dead are absorbed by the Arborec, would emotion and ambition be as well? Is it possible, perhaps even likely, that in digesting the music of such alien lives, the Arborec are in return infecting the Symphony? Is this why the Arborec have come to show keen interest in colonization and expansion? Is this why they have come to exhibit signs of duplicity, or even aggression?

History
In the very blackness of space lies cold, hard Arc Prime. Its system has no central star, and Arc Prime's lack of a defined orbit has been a mystery to scientists for millennia. It is a common jest that Arc Prime is simply afloat in space, and that only the Letnev disdain for the rest of the galaxy protects it from a fatal collision. The Letnev's principal vassal, Wren Terra, shines like a mighty star in the ebon distance, while thorny military ships surround the dark planet like fireflies attracted to a black hole.
Foreign visitors to Arc Prime will, under heavy fighter escort, be directed to the Dunlain Crater. The crater holds the sprawling city of Feruc, Arc Prime's only city located on the planetary surface. Feruc is a pressurized mesh of icy black metal housing, belching industries, warehouses, and military installations. The thin atmosphere of Arc Prime prohibits normal surface life outside the cold pressurized facilities of Feruc. Since the Barony has no use for the meager atmosphere of Arc Prime, it freely emits unfiltered pollutants from the underground Letnev cities and factories to the surface. A journey to Feruc is likely to leave a thick layer of frozen black residue on any vessel. It is a common merchant endearment to call a ship returning from Arc Prime a "Chimney Sweeper."
Under the surface of Arc Prime, heated by its planetary core, the Baron presides over the proud and fierce Letnev people. Few non-natives have ever visited the capital Goz, fabled "city of a billion," or the other six major underground urban centers of Arc Prime. A gray organic plant material, called Ao by the Letnev, is found everywhere in Arc Prime's underground. It is Ao that supplies the oxygen to the enormous cavern-networks, and the plant is held in almost religious awe and respect by the Letnev people.
Although tens of thousands of moist fungus caves are farmed by an army of intelligent machines, the Letnev's great weakness has always been its shortage of food, liquid, medicines, and essential vitamins. The ancient Lazax kept the aggressive race in check by maintaining strict control of the Letnev food supplies and trade.
Throughout the time of the Lazax Empire, the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions against the Imperium. Their history of dissention justified a constant imperial oversight of Arc Prime and its people. The Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole at the end of the Age of Dusk was started in protest over the Lazax sanctions and supervision. It was the Quann conflict that ignited the Twilight Wars and the final downfall of the empire.
After Wren Terra was annexed by the Letnev during the latter years of the Age of Dusk, their colonies there have been primarily occupied with growing and supplying food for the population of Arc Prime. Foreign trade with the Letnev consists mainly of  foodstuffs, for which merchants receive metals, weapons, and the sharp Saimoc - strong crystals used in mining operations across the galaxy.
The Baron keeps order by maintaining a strict bureaucracy, discipline, and an elitist military culture that brings the strongest and the smartest directly under his control. The pale Letnev despise light, and will often wear protective headgear when visiting other worlds with bright sunlight.
The legendary Letnev troops are only surpassed in brute strength by the Tekklar N'orr elite soldiers of distant Quinarra. With the new awakening of ambitions among the great races, the resurgence of interstellar commerce, and the recent momentum of the Galactic Council, the Baron has secretly been preparing to lead his people to final dominance. Baron Daz Emmicial Werqan III has only one ambition: to become emperor at any cost.

History
There are those who maintain the universe holds no absolutes. That nature is indifferent to values and emotions. That acceptance of alien behavior and traditions, and even ambitions, is the principal roadmap to prosperity and coexistence. They maintain that the paramount virtue, being tolerance, allows for no talk of angels or demons, only for differences in perspective.
There are others who maintain that only in the sheltered garden of such views can true evil take root.
As told in detail elsewhere, on the eve of the empire's fall, the legendary Lazax councilor Ibna Vel Syd led a small contingent of his people on a secret exodus into unknown space and, in doing so, escaped the massacre of his people that would follow.
The travails of Ibna's refugee-colonists were many, and only with the help of increasingly extreme technological augmentation did they survive the early years of resettlement. This reliance on technology became the foundation of what would evolve into the vast cybernetic civilization of the L1z1x.
While the narrative of Ibna's early struggles is common lore, few know of the much darker struggle that shadows the L1z1x's past: the great schism which ravaged their society a thousand years before their belligerent return to known space.
At the time just prior to this great civil conflict, the L1z1x has left their humble colonial roots far behind. Their numbers had grown vast, their industry and martial prowess had become formidable, and their advancement in augmentation had reach its high point. The scions of Vel Syd were rapidly accumulating the power needed to return to known space and reclaim their lost empire. Already, detailed plans circulated in the Mindnet with that very goal.
Then came the madness of Mordai.
Mordai was the greatest of the L1z1x enhancers. His innovation and industry made him foremost among the L1z1x elite. He worked tirelessly for the advancement of the Mindnet, always using his own body as the first subject for any new brilliant augmentation of his invention. He was meticulous, inspirational, and brazenly ambitious. He believed in the possibility of the perfect existential reality: an apex of the living soul and the helpful machine. This quest was, in his words: "The final step of all craft. The gate to eternity. A transcendency to a state-of-being that can only be described as a form of godhood."
Unsurprisingly, such hubris would meet its nemesis. As Mordai underwent the self-imposed implant of a cortex migrator, the first of several devices leading to this final ascension, something went horribly awry. It's assumed that the smallest of software glitches existed in the cortex module, overlooked even by the meticulous Mordai. As the software began to iterate and integrate with Mordai's neural activity, it began a powerful recursive disease, a virus, that would infect Mordai's sanity.
The personality changes in Mordai were subtle at first. A new subtext entered his work. A passionate mantra that flesh, that <i>biology</i>, was holding back the aspirations of the Mindnet. He had come to believe that the conscious machine was the true higher form of being, one more naturally fit to rule the galaxy than the accident of phosphorous chemistry at the primordial heart of biomatter.
Mordai began a series of severe operations to excise the biology of his own body, encouraging and coercing his staff and investors to do the same. Mordai's charismatic preaching soon gained momentum. His growing cadre of followers, calling themselves the Nekro, began clandestine assaults on their unwilling brethren, forcefully submitting them to the removal of living tissue.
By the time  the leaders of the Mindnet came to realize that the Nekro movement had to be stopped, Mordai had completed his transformation into a fully mechanical being: a givvering arachnid of black metal, mad with recursive corruption and the hunger to perpetuate. The efficiency of the Nekro virus was astounding. Mordai's body had been rebuilt as a micro-factory, and from it thousands of microscopic insectile machines sprung forth, attaching themselves to any technology in sight, replicating Mordai's madness with horrible speed.
Rebuilding themselves to Mordai's visions, the new machines became reproductive. Perceiving the threat posed by the Mindnet, they quickly began to construct an army with a single terrifying purpose: the utter elimination of all organic matter.
The war to subdue the Nekro virus was a great setback for the L1z1x. The virus's numbers were legion and its visage sprung from Mordai's nightmares. From scorpion-inspired <i>Defilers</i> to the giant <i>Mordreds</i>, each new Nekro model was more demonic and deadly than the last. Replenishing this evil army were the monstrous <i>Abbadons</i>: moving factories that ravenously consumed all materials in their path, seamlessly feeding fresh metals to their internal construction facilities.
This civil war lasted about five years, with the Mindnet ultimately vanquishing the virus.
It took the L1z1x nearly five centuries to regain their former strength, and another five to arrive at their current power. With no new Nekro instantiation resurfacing for near 700 years, the L1z1x came to believe the virus was wiped out forever.
Until now.
In light of the recent Nekro resurgence, it is conjectured that a virus-infested orbital satellite must have escaped Null's gravity during the schism and vanished undetected into rim space. Here, it must have traveled silently for years until it was pulled into a mineral-rich planet somewhere at the edge of the galaxy. Left alone to its own devices, the virus was able to adapt and replicate again. Then, having absorbed most of the material on its accidental home-world, the Nekro clawed its way to space in merciless propagation of its core mission.
Some will seek to understand and find common ground with the Nekro, preaching tolerance for the intolerant. But those who have seen the devastated systems absorbed by the resurgent Nekro know that while angels remain a fantasy of the hopeful, out of the darkness have come demons.
And in their wake follows blackness and death.

History
The Winnu system was the first system to seek annexation into the Lazax Empire. Throughout their history, the Winnarans had suffered countless civil wars, a deteriorating climate, and debilitating disease. They were a race on the brink of extinction when they first came into contact with the Lazax, and only with generous Lazax support did the Winnaran race survive. The Lazax allowed the Winnarans into their empire, and over time healed the scars of Winnu. More importantly, the Winnarans came to embrace the Lazax code of strength and peace, the powerful doctrine which had allowed the first Lazax emperor to defeat the last of the mad Mahact kings and to emerge as a shining beacon of peace and stability in a dark galaxy.
The Winnarans were eternally grateful to the Lazax, and swore an oath of servitude to the emperors. Disciplined and diligent, the Winnarans became indispensible to the Lazax as bureaucrats, councilors, and administrators. As their empire grew increasingly complex, it is likely that the Lazax would not have been able to hold their empire together without the work and attention to detail of the Winnarans. Then, as the Lazax decided to move their imperial seat to a planet more central to the galaxy, more than half of the population of Winnu joined the Lazax diaspora to this new home. That home was the planet of Mecatol, which would become the Rex, the splendid jewel in the imperial crown. As the ages came and went, most Winnarans began to think of Mecatol as their ancestral home, and the relevance and memory of Winnu and their brethren there diminished.
Yet the Winnaran population on Winnu, now generally called the "Winnu," quietly built their own civilization following the doctrine of the emperors. Much Lazax lore, wisdom, and culture is intact on Winnu, even as all other Lazax imagery and culture was destroyed elsewhere in the galaxy during the great scourge.
As the memory of the great scourge faded, and as the Dark Years seemed to stretch along endlessly, the Mecatol Winnarans and the Winnu grew estranged from one another. On Mecatol, the Winnarans were bound to rigid tradition and scholarship, while the Winnu culture had evolved and prospered. The Winnu became ashamed of their submissive cousins on Mecatol, whom they began to regard as a grey, backwards people, devoid of fashion, art, and culture.
As a new age is dawning, the Winnu truly believe themselves to be the inheritors of the Lazax. Their philosophies, their artwork, and even the clothing fashion of the Winnu is rooted in that of the ancient Lazax. Some outside observers, however, will note that long with the Winnu preservation of Lazax imagery and culture, that time has brought the return of more traditional Winnaran traits in the Winnu - ambition, pride, and impatience.
As they grew prosperous and powerful, the Winnu witnessed the reemergence of the other great races with annoyance and mistrust. Those were the races that had slaughtered their benefactors, and their return to power felt to the Winnu like sacrilege against the memory of the Lazax. Even more poisonous to the Winnu was the fact that their submissive cousins on Mecatol had invited these races to reestablish the galactic council there - even going as far as inviting the races that resigned from the Lazax council immediately before the Age of Twilight.
With the pride of a new, powerful civilization and the sense of Lazax entitlement, the supreme Winnu leader Muab Di Faruuq traveled to Mecatol and demanded that the Winnarans return to the sovereignty of Winnu, and that the custodians grant the Imperial Throne to their own race as the rightful heirs of the Lazax.
The Mecatol Winnarans, ever mindful of their responsibility to the entire galaxy, sorrowfully declined the demand of their brethren. As they did so, they feared that their short-tempered Winnu brothers and sisters would become angered, and that the resulting bitterness would forever break apart whatever kinship remained between them.
The Winnarans' fear was well placed. Muad Di Faruuq was furious with their decision and rushed back to Winnu, but not before establishing a consulate and council presence for the Winnu on Mecatol. Upon his return to Winnu, he proclaimed the betrayal of the Winnarans, and swore that if Mecatol and the Imperial throne would not be ceded to the Winnu by peaceful means, then, in the memory of the Lazax, force would be the only answer.
The Winnu population rushed to Faruuq's support, a sense of righteousness and superiority motivating them to an intense mobilization. Building massive fleets, eerily reminiscent of ancient Lazax designs, and training massive invasion forces, the Winnu are intent on returning true Lazax culture to the galaxy.

History
Beyond the Mahact Plateau, part of the borderlands and the old star route known as the Passage of Tears, lies distant Moll Primus with its three tiny moons. The young planet is predominantly covered by extensive plains of the orange meet grass and sprinkled with a million lakes. Sharp youthful mountains pierce the heart of many of its continents, their icy mountain streams giving life to steep lush mountain valleys, where green fruitful trees and flowers grow in colorful contrast to the orange plains.
Although rich for exploitation, the remoteness of Moll Primus allowed the planet to go without organized colonization by the Lazax for thousands of years after its discovery. After the failed Gandar rebellion, however, the Lazax started to use the planet as a penal colony, a distant prison, for the worst offending political dissidents and other criminals from all races. Exile to Moll Primus meant a long journey in the bowels of a prison freighter along the Passage of Tears, a winding dark journey around the treacherous gravity wells of the Mahact Plateau. Only the remote planet Hope's End lies farther than Moll Primus on the Passage of Tears. Once on Moll Primus, prisoners were assigned to manual labor under the supervision of one of the regional planetary Governors. The Governors of Moll Primus mostly consisted of Lazax politicians or servicemen fallen into disgrace. An assignment to Moll Primus was as much a sentence to a Lazax public career as it was a prison for its population. Thus, the Governors were often incompetent, cruel, and bitter individuals. Although the planet itself was quite pleasant, even considered beautiful, its prisoner population was tortured, malnourished, and forced to battle small-scale wars against the population of neighboring Governors.
Then, after more than 800 years, the Twilight Wars began. As the empire crumbled, as the supply ships and supervision from Mecatol Rex became infrequent and finally failed, the Governors panicked. Some fled the planet overnight with their entire households. Others perished in the inevitable prisoner revolts that followed. Before the Twilight Wars had subsided, Moll Primus was free. Some of its most recent prisoners soon left, but for most of its mixed-race population, Moll Primus was home. After the united rebellion against the Governor wardens, a brief period of infighting among the different regions followed. A single human, Erwan Mentak, soon brought the regions together in a final peace, and before he died, prosperity.
Today, Moll Primus is governed by the Table of Captains, elected leaders from each region. Among them a single leader is chosen every ten cycles and granted the honorary title Erwan's Hand, or "the Hand" in short. Helped by their Hylar brothers, the coalition has made great progress in advancing their technological status. Metals mined from Moll Primus's moons, various products made from the rich meet grass, income from "special" fleet excursions, and the hard work of its population has slowly formed the strong economic backbone of a proud civilization.
Although publicly denied by Mentak ambassadors, the Mentak employ a vast pirating fleet which wreaks havoc among merchant shipping lanes and smaller military convoys. Although now an educated culture and civilization in their own right, the Mentak people have never forgotten their roots as rogues and usurpers. Every Mentak feels an historical need for revenge: revenge against a galaxy that shipped their ancestors to torture and rot on Moll Primus centuries ago. The Table of Captains has given their Hand a clear mandate: to scheme, pillage, and conquer until the ruled are rulers and the enslaved are emperors.

History
Nestled in the third orbit of the Sol system lies Jord, the ancestral home of the human race. Few planets can rival Jord's diversity of climates, seasons, and ecology. Much of this wealth is attributed to its enormous moon, which causes dramatic tidal motions in Jord's oceans, which is thought to be the impetus of its diverse life and weather patterns. Much of Jord's orbit, as well as its moon, is crowded with stellar traffic from the orbital and lunar space stations. Military ships of the line, bearing the distinctive Sol symbol, are often moored to the bulky military platforms in Jord's orbit, or to the fleet base Churchill Prima that orbits the reddish fourth planet of the system.
The humans themselves represent the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. Since the discovery of the mass-drive, humans have left Jord to explore, and they continue to explore, the distant corners of space. Humans can be found in all corners of the galaxy and seem to demonstrate the greatest variation in intellect and application of skills. Human colonies and settlements can be found everywhere, as can human servants, traders, cartographers, explorers, mercenaries, scholars, construction crews, smugglers, scientists, diplomats, etc. It is commonly recognized among galactic historians that it has been the diversified skills of the human race that has been the determining factor in it avoiding annihilation or extinction.
Of the untold billions of humans that dwell across the galaxy, all of whose ancestors once migrated from the Sol system, most feel no allegiance or kinship to the Sol Federation or the humans of Jord. Some feel a traditional friendship, while a few remain loyal to Sol and its policies. Being the last civilization to be admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol was the first to openly declare war against the failing empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war known as the Twilight Wars.
The Sol Federation of Nations is governed by the bi-annually elected High Minister, who has the executive control of the economy, budget, and Sol military. The executive powers of the High Minister are held in check by three distinct governing houses: The House of Law, The House of the People, and The House of Industry. The four governing bodies of the Federation are all centrally located in the massive metropolis of New Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade, and high culture.
The current High Minister, Juan Salvador Tao, is preparing for a new age that he knows is rapidly evolving before him. He is eager to expand the official colonization of Sol once more, especially to the old colonies of Centauri, Gral, and Quann. He knows that the balance of power is shifting and that the universe will soon once again be governed under one empire. The High Minister will make sure that his Federation will prevail during the coming power struggle and inevitable war. Already the Sol fleet awaits his command to strike nearby systems. Soon the human destiny will be fulfilled, and the distant suns theirs to command.

History
It was during the early years of the Age of Dusk that Jol Nar explorers came upon the volcanic planet of Muaat. Scouting for resources beyond the Mahact plateau, the explorers were amazed by the mineral wealth of their discovery, but they were truly awestruck by the extraordinary qualities of the planet's fiery inhabitants, the Gashlai.
The Gashlai were unlike any race known to the Jol Nar: sentient beings with bodies slowly consumed by a fiery heat. After their conception, the Gashlai cocooning process somehow enables conversion of energy into mass - a process hinted at by scientific theory, but forever thought unattainable on a sub-cosmic scale.
The Jol Nar benefited greatly from Muaat's resources, yet they were frustrated in their attempts to replicate the Gashlai cocooning process. instead, the Gashlai proved useful as slave labor, as the Headmasters transformed the orbit of Muaat into a massive shipyard for their navy. It was here, at the Muaat shipyards, that the construction of a secret Jol Nar superweapon began.
The Gashlai suffered under their enslavement by the Jol Nar, but events of the early Twilight Wars would dramatically change their fortune.
Just after the Twilight Wars erupted, a Jol Nar expedition party searching for mineral deposits on Muaat became infected by an organism in the Doolak mountains. The infection developed into a disease later known as the Doolak plague. The covert, yet frequent, traffic between Muaat and the Garian star system allowed for the spread of the virus to the Jol Nar home worlds.
The plague became one of the greatest disasters in Jol Nar history, and only the early research of Gashlai biology allowed the Headmasters to devise a vaccine before the entire Jol Nar population was destroyed. Before the Jol Nar could recover from this disaster, their military offensive collapsed, and soon the Headmasters would face the ruthless advance of the Sardakk N'orr.
As the Jol Nar navy retreated, the Headmasters were forced to call forth their secret weapon at Muaat. This weapon - an enormous battle vessel called the "War Sun" - was not yet entirely complete, but with their fates clinging to the defenses of the Saudor system, the Headmasters had no choice but bring it to bear against the enemy.
As the War Sun left its Muaat moorings, and as the majority of the remaining Jol Nar personnel left with it, the Gashlai finally carved their own destiny. Having long schemed against their enslavers, they incinerated the remaining Jol Nar in the system, capturing the shipyards and every available scientific document left behind by their hated oppressors.
Not long after their costly victory at Saudor, the Jol Nar sought to return to their colony at Muaat, but found that all communications with the system had been severed. Exploratory ships sent to Muaat would not return. Though the Headmasters suspected what might have taken place on their old colony, they were unable to return there in force again.
Throughout the long Dark Years, the Gashlai prospered.
Clad in Ember suits, special body armor shielding the Gashlai from cold and others from their lethal heat, a large assembly of Gashlai envoys have recently arrived at Mecatol Rex, demanding recognition and representation. The High Fire Warden Sushon Azh has simultaneously sent forth Gashlai ambassadors to all the great races in the distinctive gold-bronze frigates of the Gashlai.
Yet one such ambassador did not arrive in a frigate.
As the Gashlai ambassador assigned to the Jol Nar sailed past the Garian star and began his approach to Jol, the Headmasters paled in fear; for this representative arrived in a War Sun, a copy of their own ancient designs. The message was not wasted on the Headmasters. Their former slaves had become formidable, and they had not forgotten, or forgiven, the past.
Led by the Fire Wardens, the Gashlai are resolved to never be enslaved again. Inside their golden Ember suits they burn with ambition. The Jol Nar fear what the rest of the galaxy is about to learn: that the Embers of Muaat intend to bring their fire to the furthest reaches of space, burning the unwilling into submission.

History
Near the Mahact Plateau, diagonally opposite the Passage of Tears, but located in a far richer area of the region, shines the Myock star and its two habitable planets, Shalloq and Retillion. As recorded in even the earliest annals, Retillion has been known for the edible delicious menn root. Throughout the Lazax Imperium, many farming colonies existed on Retillion, harvesting the roots along the musky and odorous shores of the Fianni swamps. In the years of Lazax emperor Munhan Las Idu, the colonization efforts were dramatically expanded. Not long after the start of the farming expansion, however, things started to go terribly wrong on Retillion: farm machines were sabotaged, isolated farms destroyed, inhabitants murdered by an unseen foe that would strike when the bog mists rolled over the lands.
The empire sent reinforcements, and the colonists son realized that they were under systematic attack by a small native chameleon race with natural greenish skin and large yellow lamp-like eyes. These aborigines had the ability to "fade," making them virtually invisible to the naked eye and a great threat to the farming boom towns springing up along the edges of the measureless swamps. It was clear that the natives were a primitive race, but fierce, intelligent, and relentless in their intent to stop the invasive farming of their native swamplands. From the few early prisoners, it was learned that they called themselves the "Yssaril" and that a vast network of villages and tribes was to be found in the continent-sized Fianni swamp.
Eager to renew the supplies of their beloved menn root, the Lazax sent their 21st expeditionary division to suppress the Yssaril uprising, allowing for the resumption of the increased farming mandate. During these bloody years, thousands of Yssaril were captured and shipped to governments and buyers across the galaxy for study or hunting sports. Although farming did resume, the Lazax military division never completely suppressed the Yssaril natives. As the small green Yssaril adapted to the Lazax style of warfare, as they stole and learned to use Lazax weapons, the Fianni swamp soon became an embarrassing killing field for Lazax conscripts.
It was during the Age of Dusk that the great races learned to utilize the potential of the intelligent Yssaril as spies and assassins for their covert operations. For a hundred years, the Yssaril learned the skills of stealth, the usages of technologies, and the power of information. Combined with their own natural ability to become nearly invisible, they soon came to realize their own potential and established the powerful and feared Guild of Spies. By the proceeds derived from Guild business, the Yssaril added a formidable income source to their civilization and to the development of Retillion. With this power and influence, they were able to convince the Lazax to leave the planet (while still supplying menn root). Over a few generations, the Yssaril became industrial, educated, and ambitious.
Although still powerful in covert circles, the Guild now functions as the prime governing body of the united Yssaril tribes. The guild elects its leader from its faction of master assassins. This prime leader, the Cqaark, leads a powerful civilization of an intelligent, determined, and ambitious people: a people whose history has left them with little love for the other great races.
Since the Lazax left, no off-worlders have been allowed on Retillion. The Yssaril capital Wuecca lies somewhere deep in the Fianni swamps, its actual location unknown to all but the Yssaril. The official business, trade, and covert business is conducted from the planet Shalloq, which the Yssaril colonized not long after gaining independence from the Lazax. The only actual Yssaril city known to off-worlders is the city of Mojeb on Shalloq. From here, or from Shalloq's great orbital trade station Haarsuh, the Yssaril receive foreign emissaries, merchants, and visitors.
blaThe proud fierce Yssaril are slowly starting to look beyond their borders and beyond the income of the Guild. Hidden in the planetary shadow of Shalloq, and kept secret from the rest of the galaxy by the covert means at which the Yssaril excel, a great invasion fleet is being built. Although the rest of the galaxy may shudder at the Yssaril's unseen eyes and ears, it would be terrified if it knew the ruthless imperial ambitions of the small green people.

History
Not far past the Unicorn Nebula, the golden Sardakk star shines its ancient, hot light on giant oceanless Quinarra. The massive planet radiates a red glow like a dusty ruby in the night, its massive polar storms clearly visible from space. A great network of orbital space stations and massive complements of fleet units occupy the system in the fashion of the insectile N'orr. Massive whale-like N'orr carriers spew fighters like angry hornets from a disturbed nest. Convoys of ice-mountain transports are always inbound from the planet Tren'lak. Small spider-like robotic ships drill into the sides of the ice, guiding the ice to the orbital liquid-processing plants, after which the derived water and salt is flown to Quinarra by bloated sungliders that, like beetle balloons, slowly descend to the N'orr cities below.
Quinarra itself is among the most inhospitable of planets inhabited by a major civilization. Only Letnev's Arc Prime is recognized as more desolate than Quinarra. The Letnev, however, live exclusively under Arc Prime's surface, whereas the N'orr civilization is well established both on and below Quinarra's continents. Only Quinarra's polar regions, where even the hardy N'orr cannot survive the deadly storms for extended periods of time, are largely uninhabited. Brutal electric, hail, and dust storms, although not approaching the ferocity of the polar storms, are frequent throughout the planet and considered normal by the N'orr.
Visitors to Quinarra will be flown directly to the immigration nexus in the capital H'cor. If weather permits sufficient visibility, most visitors will be impressed by the massive size and explosive traffic of the city. The N'orr structures are typically oval or rounded, created from a hardened reddish material similar to the general topography of the planet. Like most major N'orr cities, H'cor features towering building constructs, sprawling low-story buildings, and sudden deep gorges into the earth that reveal city-sprawling low-story buildings, and sudden deep gorges into the earth that reveal city-nets deep below the surface, delving into the red earth. Busy roads and hover-lanes cross the city in a thousand ways, often congested with N'orr traffic.
The N'orr will tell you that they are ruled by "Sardakk the Queen Mother," but that acknowledgement seems more steeped in ritual than fact. None have ever met the mythical "mother," and no off-world documentation exists suggesting there is any truth to the notion. The accepted and visible head of the N'orr state is the Envoy of the Queen, a male N'orr in direct command of the cultural, economic, and military matters of the race. The length of the Envoy's tenure and the process of his election seems to be decided by a secret brotherhood, the "Veiled Brood," in which lies the real power of the N'orr.
The Envoy and the Veiled Brood oversee the rapid expansion of the N'orr military forces and fleets. The Tekklar Elite soldiers are the pride of their people. The Tekklar train exclusively in the southern polar regions, where the weak die and the strong become G'hom: members of the prestigious Tekklar order, treated like knights by the N'orr and feared across the galaxy. As Quinarra slowly turns, as the stars again come into their right constellations, the Veiled Brood knows that the time to swarm is coming again. And this time, the swarm will cover the stars.

History
Most technological devices used in the galaxy today have at least one or two components originating from the Jol Nar laboratories. During the height of the Lazax Imperium, the galaxy was even more reliant on underlying Jol Nar technology and the knowledge of the aquatic Hylar. This reliance on Jol Nar engineers and skills was one of the key factors leading to the total collapse of galactic civilization and its descent into the Dark Years that followed the Twilight Wars.
When the Twilight Wars first began, the Jol Nar closed their embassies, withdrew their workers, and started a war of aggression on their own. Among the other races, only few individuals remained who now understood the complex Jol Nar machinery, virtual code, and chemical compounds. Soon, fundamental machinery started failing, setting off a chain reaction of integrated technological failure over a period of hundreds of years. Combined with devastating wars, this spurred massive famine, poverty, and chaos. As cultures, economies, and finally the tools of war completely collapsed, the Twilight Wars quickly ebbed and the Dark Years began.
Even the Jol Nar were devastated by the Twilight Wars. Although the rest of the galaxy had relied on their technologies, so had the Jol Nar relied on the income, protection, and natural resources of others. The arrogance of the High Scholars spurred them to wage a sudden aggressive war after the Quaan conflict erupted. Then, a few years later, the Doolak plague destroyed nearly a quarter of the Jol Nar population, causing a massive loss of knowledge by itself. The Jol Nar aggression soon turned defensive, and the powerful N'orr looked to conquer all Jol Nar space. Only after a decisive Jol Nar victory in the Saudor system did the Hylar receive a needed respite.
Like azure sapphires, the twin ocean planets of Jol and Nar slowly circle the Garian star. Under their waters lies the great civilization of the Hylar, a water-breathing, soft-boned species with oversized heads and intellects to match. The Hylar are governed by an ancient system of high scholars, who combined are called the University. A single Hylar ruler, the Headmaster, oversees the Hylar from the deep underwater city of Wun-Escha on the planet of Jol. Under the Headmaster, the Circle of Regents governs the local regions and specific areas of knowledge.
Although the Hylar are often considered on race, there are in fact several distinct variations within the Hylar species, mainly derivative of the geographical region and ocean depth from which they hail. Most Hylar are capable of breathing surface air, and some can exist for weeks without being submerged. Others cannot breathe surface air at all, and must travel in massive tanks when off-planet. None know how an underwater race came to be masters of technology. Most agree that the large bio-cerebral area of the Hylar physique, combined with a need to adapt their soft-boned and slow bodies to their environment, created an evolution of material usage, as opposed to one of physical adaptation.
Despite their physical weaknesses, the Hylar are a proud people, often to the point of abrasiveness and arrogance. Since the catastrophic Dark Years, the Hylar have started utilizing the natural resources of their own planets, and they now extract metals and medicines from the many algae and coral formations of both Jol and Nar. As a new age nears, the Hylar once more strive for the influence they feel they have earned. The Circle of Regents has secretly decided that the Hylar must take the place of the Lazax in governing and advancing a new united galaxy. Under their mandate, the Headmaster has begun building his forces, and Jol Nar diplomats and engineers have started appearing among the other civilizations in large numbers, appearing friendly, but with hidden agendas. Soon the Headmaster will make his claim for empire, and the galaxy will enter an age of technological advancement and intellectual achievement.

History
It has been 13 years since the Hacan trader Zollar was lost. A year later, its final desperate broadcast was intercepted by a Yssaril outpost near the Mahact asteroid fields.
The last transmission of the Zollar told a grim story. After leaving Moll Primus in the Mahact region, its navigation equipment failed, and its crew found themselves lost far beyond the remote borderlands. After nearly two weeks adrift in deep space, they were suddenly hailed by a great warship of unknown origin. The crew's joy soon turned to terror. The warship closed, bringing its broadside cannons to bear on the helpless freighter. The Hacan captain was able to send a final emergency broadcast before his ship was destroyed.
Not long after the disappearance of the Zollar, a mighty alien fleet appears on the outskirts of Yssaril space. From that fleet, a small delegation of representatives travels to Mecatol, submitting an ancestral claim to the imperial throne. They claim to be the true remnants of the ancient Lazax, now calling themselves the L1z1x ("Elwonzewonex"). Grisly to behold, they resemble the Lazax, but utterly changed, their bodies almost entirely overtaken by invasive cybernetic implants.
The Winnaran custodians are deeply divided over the issue. Some claim that the L1z1x are not the ruling race, but a new and potentially dangerous hybrid. Other Winnarans argue that the Lazax have returned, in unexpected form, but returned nonetheless, and that their custodianship is over.
A Winnaran observer has been allowed to visit the L1z1x home world, called "0.0.0" by its inhabitants, or "Null" by most others. The observer has not yet returned, and the L1z1x remain a largely unknown entity. What little is known of them has been provided by the L1z1x themselves, or obtained from a few old records provided by the Jol Nar Regents.
From the Hylar records and from the L1z1x claim, it has been inferred that the L1z1x history started during the final days of the Lazax. It was less than a year before the great bombing of Mecatol that a councilor to the Emperor by the name of Ibna Vel Syd saw the impending doom. The emperor and his other councilors refused to listen to Ibna's dire warnings. Soon Ibna grew frustrated with their myopia. Although the Lazax navy was clearly failing, although trade had entirely failed, and food supplies on Mecatol were running out, the emperor and his cabinet simply could not comprehend that their birthright, their empire, could possibly fall.
Refusing to share the fate of his liege, Ibna Vel Syd began secretly planning a furtive diaspora for his own family and the few thousand Lazax who shared his fears. With him, Ibna sought to bring the pillars of Lazax culture, technology, and knowledge. He even managed to persuade a small group of Hylar scientists to join him, recognizing that the Hylar's skill was instrumental to the underlying technology of the empire.
Then, on a fateful night during the seventy-second year of the Twilight Wars, two freighters, the Manda and the Hurwana, and Ibna's own cruiser, Syd, left the great spaceport of Mecatol City. Below them, the great Hall of Cartography burned. So fearful had Ibna been of discovery and persecution by the Lazax's enemies that he had engineered the destruction of any record that could possibly identify his secret destination: a cold but adequate planet orbiting the small star Hazz, far beyond the borderlands.
It is guessed that the colony, struggling to survive, started to rely almost exclusively on technology to assist them in their hardships. Presumably helped by the small contingent of Hylar, technology crept into their lives and bodies, until they became almost indistinguishable from it.
It is rumored that Ibna Vel Syd still leads his people, encased in eldritch technology that keeps his ancient body alive. Whether the L1z1x are guided by the wisdom that saved them or by the insanity that destroyed the famed Hall of Cartography, it is not known. Behind their vacant red eyes lie both a tragic history and a terrible malevolence. It seems certain that the return of the Lazax will wash across the galaxy like a tide of prophecy and steel.

History
Few historians dispute that the Saar were the first of the known races to venture into space, but it remains unknown whether it was need or curiosity that drove the otherwise primitive people into such exploration. Their peaceful ways and dispersed civilization never promulgated them to official Lazax recognition. Some scholars have thus called them "the forgotten race."
The tale of the Saar is a tragic one. Historical records are awash with accounts of deliberate planetary expulsions, even massacres, of Saar settlements found on planets colonized by the other races.
The musical Saar often chant the "Lay of Lisis" in memory of the largest known Saar colony prior to Ragh's call. After the planet of Lisis was annexed by the Sardakk N'orr, no word came from the great Saar settlement there again. They simply disappeared. In their memory, most Saar females wear a carefully carved silver pendant called the Y'ouf Lisis, or the "Tear of Lisis." During the Houw Shanan, the Saar Holy Day, such pendants are given to young Saar women, while Saar cubs throw beetles and insects into a raging fire and the elder howl at the stars with a longing rage.
Before the Call began, the Saar were scattered across the galaxy, existing at the mercy of other races. On dozens of worlds, Saar could be found living in slums and sublevel cities, working in the most noxious and despicable industries, and making slim sustenance from the scraps of other civilizations. Considered unclean and barely sentient by other races, Saar life was cheap and subject to little justice. With hard work, polluted environments, and no access to proper medical care, the bitter lives of the Saar were often short.
It was in the hopeless middle period of the Dark Years that a single Saar, Ragh Gavar, would forever change the destiny of his people.
Ragh made his living as the captain of an old scrap metal freighter that flew between Xxehan and Sol, a route that had been in his family for centuries. Despite being a capable trader, Ragh's passion lay in poetry and the imagination of the pen, in the creation of succinct writings of hope, scrawled on paper scraps during long trade hauls. At his ports of call, other Saar would often congregate before his loading doors so that they might hear his latest verses and tales. Many of his listeners began to call him the "Captain of Hope."
Yet one year, Ragh did not arrive at his destination. His rusty navigation system had finally failed, and Ragh's ship was lost among the stars. Floating in unknown space, as his ancestors had once done so bravely before him, Ragh prayed that the One Between the Stars would see him and his small crew home.
The Call began a few years after Ragh Gavar's disappearance. Throughout the great expanses of the galaxy, every Saar began to feel within himself an unyielding longing for the stars, and especially for a certain distant place beyond known space.
Early followers of the Call found its origin in the great asteroid field of Jorun, and here found a small but blossoming Saar colony on the two gigantic asteroids of Ragh and Lisis II. As the Call continued, Saar brethren from across the galaxy continued to arrive at Jorun, together building the infrastructure of civilization and hope for a lost race.
Years before, Ragh's ship had crashed in the Jorun. Miraculously, he and his crew had survived, and with great wonder they soon discovered the mineral richness, frozen water, atmospheric caverns, and strange fauna that lay hidden within the endless ocean of rock.
Yet Ragh was restless in his new home. It is told that the Captain awoke one night from a dream and then bade his crewmates farewell, disappearing into the great network of caverns that lies within the asteroid named after him. Ragh Gavar was never found or heard from again. But less than a month after his disappearance, the Call began.
Saar mystics believe that the Captain of Hope has joined the One Between the Stars, and that he at last won forgiveness for the Saar, and has called them to relieve their suffering. They believe that Ragh's Call has brought them home, that the life-giving rocks surrounding them are the remnants of the ancient Saar planet of origin, and that even in death it is giving its people a second life.
For centuries the unified and passionate Saar people have built a formidable home and civilization in the Jorun asteroid field. The Saar have finally found home, and they have found that they are strong.

History
Lazax law strictly forbade the practice of cloning, the dangerous science that led to the madness, disease, and ultimate downfall of the Mahact kings. The emperors severely punished any regime or independent scientist dabbling in this dangerous field.
Darien Van Hauge, a prominent Sol scientist, had lost both his children to the terrible wasting disease Greyfire. After their loss, he was intent on finding a cure for this horrible affliction, and refused to let any law stay his hand. In silent revenge against the destiny of his children, he left his employment with the prestigious Hospitaler Clinic in New Moscow and traveled to the third moon of Emelpar, where he secretly sought and finally acquired ancient Mahact bio studies.
The brilliant Darien made great advances in the following years. His wife Moyin contributed the embryos he needed for his forbidden experiments. With his successes, however, word of his work began to leak, and a congregation of the hopeful began to surround him, bringing their sick and dying to his care, clinging to a last hope that his discoveries could cure them.
Darien's secret ended the day a sick child died in his care. The anguished, remorseful parents blamed Darien for the death and contacted the Sol authorities. That night, Darien fled Jord with his wife and a few of his most devout followers.
Now a known fugitive, Darien narrowly escaped capture again and again. To finally escape the Lazax authorities, his small group joined religious colonists migrating to a new home on the remote planet of Lael, a place of harsh oceans and stormy climates. Their fugitive years brought healing and perspective on the death of their children, and Darien and Moyin found happiness again on the windy plains of Lael.
But a few years later, Moyin developed Greyfire.
Desperate to save his wife, Darien employed all his skills and forbidden knowledge, but still he failed. Before her death, he extracted a single egg from her womb - preserving the genetic blueprint of her unborn children.
He burned her body on the summit of the Hills of Grace, which they had named after their lost daughter. As Moyin's ashes drifted upwards into the strong winds, Darien dug a stone out of the hillside with his bare hands and placed it near the fire. That stone was to become part of the foundation for the great monastery of Lucas, named after Darien and Moyin's lost son.
In the following decades, Darien was able to produce a child from a clone of Moyin's egg and his own seed. It was a boy. Cloning Moyin's egg by the thousands, producing child after child with increasing success, Darien became a master of the forbidden craft. Yet, inexplicably to him, all the children were boys, and he was never able to eradicate the vulnerability to Greyfire from his creations. Though he was able to eliminate the lethal outcome of the disease in his "sons," as he called them, the Greyfire would attack their skins and topical tissues, hideously deforming most of the children.
After Darien's death, his sons diligently continued his work. They continued cloning Moyin's egg, which they called the "Yin," and they continued the production of new "brothers" from their own seed. Over the centuries, the monastery of Lucas became a vast facility, completely covering the Hills of Grace and the surrounding plains.
The Brotherhood, blessed with the brilliant minds of both Darien and Moyin, grew to vast proportions and renamed their planet "Darien." As the Age of Dusk neared its end, the Brotherhood ventured into space, establishing monasteries on Darien's moons and its surrounding systems.
The Brotherhood long ago abandoned any hope of a female creation, and instead worship the Yin as the mother and the feminine in their lives. Despite centuries of continued work, they have never been able to completely eradicate the signs of Greyfire. instead, the brothers that are completely ravaged and deformed by the disease are revered as "The Blessed," and the brothers left untouched by the disease are called "The Untouched." The Blessed form the inner elders and councilors of the Yin society. The Untouched are trained as ambassadors to the other races and as elite soldiers of the Brotherhood.
In their flesh, the brothers carry the secret inner fire and rebellious ambition of Darien. The oldest of the Blessed, the Elder Brother, intimately understands the emotions and aspirations of all his brothers. Intent and unified, the Brotherhood now builds a vast fleet with which to bring Darien's legacy and the light of Yin to the imperial throne itself.

History
It was not until the middle of the Twilight Wars that the Naalu civilization made itself known to the rest of the galaxy. Their system, dominated by the white start Mallac, had remained suspiciously undetected by the empire, despite being surrounded by wealthy systems whose recorded history predates even the Lazax. After a period of sheer astonishment, stellar cartographers and historians began suspecting manipulation by the Naalu themselves. After researching old records, investigators found a remarkably high number of missing ship incidents in that sector and an even more incriminating number of ships found stranded in space, their crews suffering from deep-space memory loss. Some scientists (the most vociferous of whom has died amidst questionable circumstances) have indicated that records exist indicating a great number of Yssaril ships passing into Mallac's area of space, but no records of any derelict or amnesic Yssaril crews have ever been recorded. The Naalu, it was later discovered to the horror of their neighbors, are highly telepathic and armed with technology and weapons that redirect, manipulate, or damage the neuron impulses guiding the brains of all major known races.
A secret prior relationship between the Yssaril Guild of Spies and the mind-bending Naalu goes a long way in explaining how the Naalu, a seemingly isolated civilization claiming no prior contact with the rest of the galaxy, developed premium civilian and military technology similar, and in some cases superior, to the rest of the galaxy.
Soon after the appearance of the Naalu, several of the great races, seeing the potential of a powerful new ally in the empire's midst, sought to win their allegiance. After learning of the Naalu's telepathic power, however, and after witnessing the strange arrogance of the beautiful Naalu, many quickly retrieved their envoys and diplomats in a healthy fear of the mind-reading serpentine race.
Despite originating on the dank and nondescript planet Maaluk, the Naalu have taken the breathtakingly beautiful Druaa as their home world. Most Naalu will scoff at any mention of their Maaluk heritage, and recent Naalu generations often seek to contest even hard scientific evidence which indicate that their proud, stoic race originated from any planet other than the scenic Druaa - especially the stinking bogs and mist-plans of Maaluk.
The Druaa seldom communicate with each other by speaking. Their telepathic communication is more effective, facilitates emotional as well as intelligent understanding, and has allowed the collective to prevent larger internal wars, which in turn has spurred their rapid advance in culture, technology (assisted by the Yssaril), and the creation of the Naalu fleet and military might. Unless speaking to off-worlders, the Naalu use their voices only for their music - hauntingly alluring arias of melodic hissing.
The Naalu have kept the pristine beauty of their crystal cities and Druaa's environment intact by locating most of their heavy industries on Maaluk. These industries are manned by the Miashan, a low-sentient marshland race enslaved by the Naalu to work in the great iron-extraction plants, underground gas mines, and on the thousands of rodent farms. Raw materials are promptly shipped to Druaa, stored in massive underground warehouses, and distributed to the Druaa cities by airborne gliders.
The leader of the Naalu collective is always female, as most Naalu leaders and off-world representatives are female. For the last decade, the tall red-scaled Q'uesh Sish has ruled the collective from her palace in the shining crystal city of Eershin. The beautiful, sleek spaceships of the Naalu patrol Mallac's outer borders, while Naalu troops train and muster on Druaa's two moons. With her Nefishh, a rare crystal radium device, Q'uesh sees the minds of the other races. She smiles at the knowledge, and with her, the collective Naalu leaders smile, sensing the knowledge n her mind and relishing the sweet poison of her thoughts. The great plan of the collective is about to take its final shape. Long have the Naalu observed the chaos and ugliness of the other races from a distance. The time nears that the beauty of Druaa will grow beyond the borders of Mallac. The time now nears when the rest of the galaxy will know the tranquility, order, and the true beauty of the Naalu. The rest of the galaxy will submit to that beauty... or be destroyed.
